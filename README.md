## About Me
I'm a software creator with a passion for making apps that solve everyday problems.  I'm not a coding whiz (yet!), but I'm super excited about how AI can help anyone build awesome software.  I'm all about finding smart solutions and making tech that's actually useful for people.

🌱 I'm learning new things all the time, especially how to use AI for coding.  I believe that anyone can build software with the right tools, and I'm here to prove it!

### 🧑‍🔬 My Skills:
- Literally nothing except using AI to complete a project 🐸

### 🚀 My Projects:

* **YouTube Downloader:** I built this desktop app with the help of AI to make downloading YouTube and also Facebook videos super easy. Check it out [here](https://github.com/rudra-mondal/youtube-downloader.git)!
* *...(Just wait, others are loading 😊!)*

### 🛠️ What I Use:

* **AI Coding Assistants:**  These are my superpowers! ✨ They help me write code and build apps.
* **Online Tutorials & Docs:** I'm a big fan of learning by doing, so I'm always checking out new resources.

### 🤔 What I'm Exploring:

* **The Basics of Coding:** I'm learning the fundamentals, but my main focus is on getting things done!
* **Making Apps User-Friendly:** I want my apps to be easy and enjoyable for everyone to use.
* **Revolutionizing Civil Engineering (One Day!):**  I'm currently studying for a diploma in Civil Engineering and I'm dreaming of ways to shake up the industry with innovative software solutions. 🏗️📚  I believe there's a huge potential for positive change, and I'm excited to see what the future holds!

😄 Fun Fact: Sometimes I disappear from social media to work on my own projects (aka, embrace my inner hermit mode! 🤫). I'm also a master of finding the easiest way to do things (laziness is a skill, right? 😉).

Thanks for stopping by! 😊
